# snake-game
This is one of my favourites beginner-project made so far, because it remembered me as a child playing this game at my mom's cellphone 🐍.</br>

Its has been made entirely on Python, and I put in practice some concepts like Object-oriented programming (OOP) and classes.

You could play using arrow keys.

P.S.: It was more fun coding this than actually playing as a child!
